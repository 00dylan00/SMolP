# SMOL-P: Small MOLecule Predictors

SMOL-P is a side project aimed at building predictors for small molecule compounds using a chemical checker database. The project focuses on predicting compound bioactivity through an automated machine learning pipeline.

## Project Overview

The goal of SMOL-P is to develop a robust and accurate prediction model for compound bioactivity. By leveraging a chemical checker database, the project aims to train machine learning models that can predict the bioactivity of small molecule compounds.

## Features

- Utilizes a chemical checker database for training and validation
- Implements an automated machine learning pipeline for model development
- Predicts compound bioactivity based on learned patterns and features
